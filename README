Devise - Yubikey Database Authentication
==============================

This extension to Devise adds a modified Database Authentication strategy to allow the authentication of a user with Two Factor Authentication provided by the Yubikey OTP token

This extension requires the used to already have a valid account and password and verifies that the user exists along with the password provided by verifying that the user presented a valid Yubikey OTP.

Installation
=======

This plugin requires Rails 3.0.x and Devise 1.3.4+. Additionally the Yubikey Ruby library found here is required

	https://github.com/titanous/yubikey

Currently this can only be installed as a plugin.

	rails plugin install git://github.com/mort666/yubikey_database_authenticatable.git

Setup
=====

Once the plugin is installed, all you need to do is setup the user model which includes a small addition to the model itself and to the schema.

The following needs to be added to the User module.

add_column :users, :useyubikey, :boolean
add_column :users, :registeredyubikey, :string

then finally add to the model :

	class User < ActiveRecord::Base

	      devise :yubikey_database_authenticatable, :trackable, :timeoutable

	      # Setup accessible (or protected) attributes for your model
	      attr_accessible :useyubikey, :registeredyubikey, :yubiotp

		  attr_accessor :yubiotp
		
		  def registeredyubikey=(yubiotp)
		    write_attribute(:registeredyubikey, yubiotp[0..11])
		  end
		
	      ...
	end
